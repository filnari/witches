Custom Witches plugin

This is a custom plugin using the Craftbukkit API of a Minecraft server.

Built on Minecraft 1.8.8 & Craftbukkit 1.8.8

It simply gives Witches a chance to drop pre written books that give information on the server's gate system.
The gate system is currently provided by another bukkit plugin called Skript. I hope to replace the functionality
of the gate system with another specialized plugin and drop the Skript plugin since it's used only for the gate system.
